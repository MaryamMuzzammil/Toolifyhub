              <h3>Why should you convert PNG to JPG?</h3>
            </button>
            <div id="FAQ">
              <p>
                If you have a PNG file, there will be some things you can’t do with it. For example, you cannot have it
                professionally printed. Since PNG files do not contain CMYK color information, a professional printing company
                won’t accept them.
                Additionally, PNG files contain transparency spaces. This allows for pixels within the image to be completely
                empty. If you try to print a PNG or upload it to certain places on the web, those empty spaces could be filled
                with black or white pixels, which would make the image look much different than you would expect.
                This is why converting a PNG to JPG could be very useful. JPG files don’t support transparency, so you’ll know
                exactly what an upload will look like before you upload it. Also, JPGs support CMYK colors, so you can print
                them with high accuracy.

              <h3>How is BMI calculated and Why is BMI used?</h3>
            </button>
            <div id="FAQ">
              <p>
                BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (BMI =
                weight (kg) / height (m^2)). <br>
                BMI is used as a quick and simple way to estimate a person's body fat and assess their overall health. It's
                often used by healthcare professionals as a screening tool.
